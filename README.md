#project name: telcom churn prediction

## Overview

The project focuses on customer churn prediction, exploring different machine learning models to identify potential churn factors. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv" file, containing customer information, features, and the target variable indicating whether a customer churned.

## Modeling
The project uses various machine learning models, including:

Random Forest
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, classification reports, and other relevant metrics.

## Results
The analysis compares the performance of different models and identifies key factors influencing customer churn.

## Next Steps
Possible future improvements and steps include:

## Feature importance analysis
Further hyperparameter tuning
Model deployment using Flask or FastAPI
